- 👋 Hi, I’m Stephan Holder
- 🔍 I’m interested in developing my knowledge and bettering myself to the best of my abilities in the Data Science Field. I'm especially interested in hopefully playing a role in impacting the magic algorithm we know that we deal with everyday 🧙‍♂️
- Currently learning to use Python and Microsoft Power BI
- 📫 Feel free to shoot me an email at stephan.s.holder@gmail.com!
- 🤷‍♂️ Some random stuff about me: LOTR> Harry Potter (proven fact, don't fight it 😎), I love and have played football ⚽, tennis, video games and music 🎸(I've been playing guitar for almost 15 or 16 years now)
